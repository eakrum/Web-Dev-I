            This story starts off when my family just moved from Clifton to Wayne and it was my first time being the new kid at school.
            I was a very shy student my first few days and my father would always pick me up from school when he would be
            taking his break from work. Everything was normal, I was still getting used to my new teachers and trying to
            make some new friends. Everything was different for me compared to my old school, which I really liked and built
            close friendships with.

            It was the 4th day of school on the brand new school year and my dad decided to take me to go run some errands after school.
            As a kid I loved sitting in the back middle seat because I would want to see all the cars on the road and teach
            myself how to drive because I always loved cars. We then hit a traffic jam and the last thing I can remember
            was a big 18 wheeler truck ramming right into the rear of the car. Upon impact all of the glass and windows in
            the car broke and I remember bleeding profusely from my forehead. Long story short I ended up getting 22 stitches
            on my forehead and a big scar that was visible for most of my childhood. Furthermore I ultimately ended up missing
            a month from school and was known as the kid with the scar for the better part of my elementary career.
