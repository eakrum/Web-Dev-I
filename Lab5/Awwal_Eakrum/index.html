            <h2>I am a Student at Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p>
                A lot of passions lie within building applications. I love to take on new projects and have actually started making my own
                mobile streaming app in regards to the realm of fitness. Computer Science has such a wide array of applications
                and technologies, and I love to leverage these aspects to teach myself new things as well as build cool products.
                At the moment I'm well versed in front end facing technologies and frameworks but also continuing to build
                my knowledge on backend systems and server side applications.
