Computer Science has such a wide array of applications and technologies, and I love to leverage these aspects to teach myself new things as well as build cool products. At the moment I'm well versed in front end facing technologies and frameworks but also continuing to build my knowledge on backend systems and server side applications. \n HELLOOOOO NEW PARA",
